    </p>

    <h2>1. GENERAL</h2>
    <p>
      Cash&#39;d.com (“Company,” “Cash&#39;d,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects the
      privacy of its users (“user” or “you”) that use our website located at
      www.Cash-d.com, our KashBack browser extension, and all other media forms,
      our media channels, our mobile website(s) or our mobile application(s)
      related or connected thereto (collectively, and including by each reference
      our mobile applications, as applicable, the “Platform”).
    </p>
    <p>
      The following Company privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to
      inform you, as a user of the Platform, about the types of information that
      Company may gather about or collect from you in connection with your use of
      the Platform. It also is intended to explain the conditions under which

      that information.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes our information practices with respect to our
      mobile applications, including: Cash&#39;d mobile application. Changes to
      this Privacy Policy may be made by posting the new version of the policy
      here and updating the “Last Updated” date above. Each time you use the

      Policy and review any changes since the last time you used the Platform.
    </p>

    <h3>NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE</h3>
    <p>
      When you create a Cash&#39;d account, the information you provide in
      connection with such account is collected by Cash&#39;d in its role as a
      “controller” or “business” (as defined by applicable privacy laws). You may
      be offered a financial incentive by Cash&#39;d in the form of Cash&#39;d
      Kash to complete your profile (e.g., $1 of Cash&#39;d Kash for completing
      your account profile). The financial incentive reflects the fact that, by
      completing your profile, Cash&#39;d is able to advertise to you opportunities
      to complete surveys based on your demographic information, and Cash&#39;d,
      as a company, earns money if you choose to engage in such surveys. By
      completing your profile, you are opting in to this financial incentive. You
      may opt out of this financial incentive at any time by contacting
      Cash&#39;d at <a href="mailto:privacy@Cash-d.com">privacy@Cash-d.com</a>
      with the subject line, “Opt Out of Cash&#39;d’s Financial Incentive.”
    </p>

    <h3>NOTICE OF OUR THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS’ ROLE</h3>
    <p>
      The Cash&#39;d Platform is designed to provide individuals opportunities to
      earn virtual currency rewards that may, in accordance with Cash&#39;d’s
      Terms of Service, be redeemed for cash value or other benefits. The
      information that Cash&#39;d collects in connection with your engagement of
      opportunities made available by our merchant, advertising, and corporate
      partners (collectively, our “Third-Party Partners”) is information
      Cash&#39;d collects in its capacity as a “processor” or “service provider”
      to those Third-Party Partners.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you respond to an offer to play a game, complete a survey, or otherwise
      participate in an activity with a designated reward or benefit, you are
      directing Cash&#39;d to make your information available to our Third-Party
      Partners. As a result, the disclosure of your information to these
      Third-Party Partners does not constitute a “sale” or “share” of your personal
      information (as that term may be defined by applicable privacy laws) or the
      processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes (as that
      phrase may be defined by applicable privacy laws). Please review the privacy
      policies of our Third-Party Partners to learn more about how they collect,
      use, and disclose your personal information.
    </p>

    <h3>NOTICE OF USE OF PIXELS TO COLLECT EVENT DATA</h3>
    <p>
      Our services to our Third-Party Partners require us to use pixels and
      similar tracking technologies to provide event data to such Third-Party
      Partners, so that you are able to earn any applicable rewards. This
      information is collected automatically and simultaneous to your interaction
      with the Platform. By engaging with a Third-Party Partner’s offer, you are
      directing us to disclose this information to our Third-Party Partner. This
      does not constitute a “sale” or “share” of your personal information or the
      processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes; and
      therefore, universal opt-out mechanisms will not affect this collection.
    </p>

    <h3>WE ARE IN THE UNITED STATES</h3>
    <p>
      The Platform is hosted in the United States of America and is subject to U.S.
      state and federal law. If you are accessing our Platform from other
      jurisdictions, you are transferring your personal information to us in the
      United States, and by using our Platform, you consent to that transfer and
      use of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>2. AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>
    <p><strong>A. Users of the Platform Generally</strong></p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this Policy, “Non-Personal Information” is information
      that, without the aid of additional information, does not identify, relate
      to, and cannot be directly associated with a specific person. “Personal
      Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address
      that identifies a specific person.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like most website operators, Company gathers from users of the Platform both
      Non-Personal Information and Personal Information of the sort that web
      browsers or devices, depending on their settings, may make available. That
      information includes the user&#39;s Internet Protocol (IP) address,
      operating system, browser type, WebGL capabilities, audio context rendering
      behavior, installed fonts, browser language and time zone, device type, and
      navigation data before and after using the Platform.
    </p>

    <h3>B. Web Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      A “Web Cookie” is a string of information that assigns you a unique
      identification which a website stores on a user's computer. We use cookies
      on the Platform to keep track of services you have used, record registration
      information, user preferences, and facilitate purchase procedures. Company
      also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each
      session, to improve experience and understand platform usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR DEVICES
      SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE
      PLATFORM. CERTAIN FEATURES MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THEM.
    </p>

    <h3>C. Third-Party Advertisers</h3>
    <p>
      We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit or
      use the Platform. These companies may use information about your visits to
      the Platform and other websites stored in Web Cookies to provide
      advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      To opt out of several third-party ad servers and networks simultaneously,
      visit:

        We may allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements, and we may use any of the Information we have collected to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. You can learn more about how to exercise your choices with respect to the disclosure and use of your information below.
      </p>

      <h4>D. Web Beacons</h4>
      <p>
        A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page or email and is usually invisible to the user. It allows website operators to determine whether a user has viewed a particular page or email. The Company may use Web Beacons on the Platform and in emails to count users who have visited specific pages, viewed emails, or to deliver co-branded services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web Beacons are not used to access users’ personal information. They are used to compile aggregated statistics about Platform usage and collect only limited information — such as a Web Cookie number, the time and date of a page or email view, and a brief description of the viewed content.
      </p>
      <p>
        You cannot directly disable Web Beacons, but they can be rendered ineffective by rejecting all cookies or setting your browser to prompt before accepting cookies.
      </p>

      <h4>E. Analytics</h4>
      <p>We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past activity on the Platform, including Google Analytics for Display Advertising. The information collected may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. If you do not want any information to be collected and used by Google Analytics, you can install an opt-out in your web browser (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and/or opt out from Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network by using Google's Ads Settings (www.google.com/settings/ads).</p>
      <p>We also use certain session replay technologies to record in real time your interactions with the Platform. Our vendors are restricted for using this information for purposes other than providing Cash'd services. Cash'd uses this information to improve, update, and fix our Platform and our service offerings.</p>
      <h4>F. Aggregated and De-Identified Information</h4>
        <p>
          We may share aggregated and De-Identified Information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our affiliate companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on the Platform and on websites of third parties. We may combine De-Identified Information we collect with additional Information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to the Platform and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any Personal Information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.
        </p>
      <h4>G. Mobile Device Additional Terms</h4>
          <p>
            Mobile Device. If you use a mobile device to access the Platform or download any of our applications, we may collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model and manufacturer), operating system, version information and IP address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Precise Geo-Location Information. Unless we have received your prior consent, we do not access or track any precise location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile application or our services, except that it may be possible for Company to determine from an IP address the general location of your point of connectivity, in which case we may gather and use such general location data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Push Notifications. We send you push notifications if you choose to receive them, letting you know when someone has sent you a message or for other service-related matters (e.g., to notify you if you are a giveaway winner). If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings or by following the instructions in the communication you received.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mobile Analytics. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information, such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any Personal Information you submit within the mobile application.
          </p>
      <h4>H. Social Media</h4>
        <p>
          We may provide you the option to connect your account on the Platform to your account on some social networking sites for the purpose of logging in, uploading information or enabling certain features on the Platform. When logging in using your social network credentials, we may collect the Personal Information you have made publicly available on the social networking site, such as your name, profile picture, cover photo, username, gender, friends network, age range, locale, friend list and any other information you have made public. Once connected, other users may also be able to see information about your social network, such as the size of your network and your friends, including common friends. By connecting your account on the Platform to your account on any social networking site, you hereby consent to the continuous release of information about you to us. We will not send any of your account information to the connected social networking site without first disclosing that to you. Each social network may further allow you to set privacy controls around your information on their system, and our collection of information will always follow such controls and permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the available features and shared information are subject to change without notice to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use hyperlinks on the Platform which will redirect you to a social network if you click on the respective link. However, when you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook's “Like” button, Twitter's “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social network's plugin will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that provider's servers. If you do not use these buttons, none of your data will be sent to the respective social network's plugin provider. So, for example, when you click on the Facebook's “Like” button on the Platform, Facebook will receive your IP address, the browser version and screen resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access the Platform. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the websites of these social networks and are not within our control.
        </p>
      <h5>1. COLLECTION BY OTHER MEANS, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
      <h5>2. A. Platform Registration</h5>
      <p>3. As defined above, Personal Information is information that identifies, relates to, or can be directly associated with a specific person. Company may collect a range of Personal Information from and about Platform users. Much of the Personal Information collected by Company about users is information provided by users themselves when (1) registering for our service, (2) logging in with social network credentials, (3) participating in polls, contests, giveaways, surveys or other features of our service, or responding to offers or advertisements, (4) communicating with us, (5) creating a public profile or (6) signing up to receive newsletters. That information may include each user's name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender, age, date of birth, username, hometown, and other demographic or relevant information such as household, occupation, income, and spending habits as determined by Company from time to time. Additionally, in connection with certain survey features of our Services, you may voluntarily provide information that discloses or reveals health and medical conditions, race/ethnic origin, religion, and political affiliations. Users of the Platform are under no obligation to provide Company with Personal Information of any form, with the caveat that a user's refusal to do so may prevent the user from using some Platform features.</p>

      <p>When you redeem any earnings via our site, Cash'd, through third-party service providers, uses technology to collect social security numbers, driver’s license or state identification information, biometric identifiers or information for the purposes of verifying your identity and preventing and protecting against fraud.
      Note, we may send you certain text messages in connection with your use of our Platform and our services. These messages may be both informational and promotional in nature. We will communicate with you via the phone number you provide in connection with your profile and by providing such number you expressly consent to our communication with you via text messages.
      Users may login to the Platform using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate Users identity and provide Users the option to share certain personal information such as name, email address to pre-populate the Platform's sign-up form. These services may also give Users the option to post information about their activities on this Platform to their profile page to share with others within the Users' networks.
      Users may also connect their Cash'd account with other, third-party services or applications. In connection with such authentication activities, we may receive certain details about your accounts. This information is only used and disclosed by us for authentication purposes.

        We may use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by the Platform that we think you may find valuable. We may also send you service-related announcements through the general operation of the service. Generally, you may opt out of such emails at the time of registration or through your account settings, or using an “unsubscribe” link or similar located in the email message, though we reserve the right to send you notices about your account, such as service announcements and administrative messages, even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications. If you participate in the Cash'd® Daily Giveaway Program and are randomly selected and verified as a winner, we may use your first name and last initial, or your chosen alias, in winner announcements on the Platform, guide.Cash'd.com, and in emailed newsletters.</p>
      <p>

Company reserves the right to transfer all Personal Information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Company's assets.

Personal Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization.
      Other parties we identify at the time we request the information from you.</p>

      <p>Third-parties that collect information directly from you are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personal Information that users provide directly to those third parties, or that those third parties collect for themselves. Third-parties may also process your Personal Information and Non-Personal information with the use of AI tools. These third parties include advertisers, social media platforms, providers of games, utilities, widgets and a variety of other third-party applications accessible through the Platform.

      <p>As part of the verification process, you may be provided further notice regarding the collection or storage of biometric identifiers and biometric information and be asked to provide your written release. We recommend you review such notices carefully, as well as any service provider privacy notices made available to you at the time of such notice.</p>
      <p>Cash'd will retain biometric information (if any is held by it) only so long as is necessary to fulfill the initial purpose for collecting or obtaining such information, and in any event, for no more than 3 years from the date of your last interaction with Cash'd. Once such period has expired, the information will be permanently deleted or destroyed in accordance with Cash'd’s security policies.</p>

      <h6>1. Do-Not-Track-Policy</h6>
      <h6>2. Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. The Platform currently does not respond to DNT browser signals or mechanisms because we do not engage in the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information (or other processing for targeted advertising purposes).</h6>

      <p>Our services to our Third-Party Partners (described above) require us to use pixels and similar tracking technologies to provide event data to such Third-Party Partners, so that you are able to earn any applicable rewards. This information is collected automatically and simultaneous to your interaction with the Platform. By engaging with a Third-Party Partner’s offer, you are directing us to disclose this information to our Third-Party Partner. Such disclosure does not constitute a “sale” or “share” of your personal information (as that term may be defined by applicable privacy laws) or the processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes (as that phrase may be defined by applicable privacy laws); similarly, and as a result, the use of a universal opt-out mechanism will have no effect on the collection of such information.</p>
