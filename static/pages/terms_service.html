<h1>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h1>

    This Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”)  constitutes a legally binding agreement made between you, including you individually, and any other person or entity on whose behalf you are acting (“User,” “You,” or “Your”) and Besitos Corporation, LLC DBA Cash'D, and its affiliated companies (collectively, “Cash'D,” “Company,” “We,” “Us,” or “Our”), concerning Your access to and use of the Cash'D platform, which includes www.cashforge.in website (including all related pages), the Cashback browser extension, as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website, or mobile application related or connected thereto, whether accessed via a computer, mobile device, or otherwise (collectively, the “Platform”, which also includes all images, information and content within the Platform). The Platform offers virtual rewards to Users for select activities on the Platform (the “Company Services”). By using the Platform or any Company Services, as well as by taking any action such as clicking an “I Agree” check-box or similar action, You agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as well Our collection, use, and disclosure of Your personally identifying information in accordance with Our policy. Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Platform from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated into this Agreement by reference. In the event of any conflict between any supplemental terms and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail unless expressly stated otherwise in the supplemental terms.
</p>
<h2>1. VIRTUAL CURRENCY EARNINGS</h2>

<p>
    Company may offer one or more rewards programs under which Users may earn virtual currency rewards in the form of Cash'D “cash”, which has a $1 = $1 U.S. Dollar conversion rate. Cash'D cash is worth zero, considered unearned, and has no redeemable value until a user has achieved the minimum account balance required to be eligible to make a payment request and a user payment request has been made, and acknowledged and approved by Cash'D. The current minimum balance required for redemption is $10, but this is subject to change at Cash'D’s sole discretion.
    Cash'D cash is non-transferable and non-assignable, may not be bartered or sold, and is void if a transfer of any kind is attempted, and Cash'D cash and the associated User account are not transferable upon death, as part of a domestic relations matter, or otherwise by operation of law.
</p>
<h3>A. Earnings Requirements</h3>
<p>
    Users may complete various activities or use features, services, and applications on or through the Platform to earn rewards, such as taking surveys, completing offers, completing transactions, playing games, participating in giveaways, and referring friends (collectively, “Rewards Programs”). These activities may include and be subject to additional terms, official rules, or agreements. Cash'D may be compensated by third parties with which it has a business relationship (“Third-Party Partners”) for these actions, which may include signing up for products and services, requests for more information, offer purchases, market research studies, video content distribution, playing games, search, and more. The tracking and reporting of these activities for the purpose of crediting Users with Cash'D cash is dependent on outside events including the Third-Party Partner’s discretion. If You choose to participate in and follow the instructions associated with a Rewards Program, upon satisfying all of the requirements of the Rewards Program, You will be awarded the cash associated with that Rewards Program as long as Company and/or its Third-Party Partners are able to properly track Your participation in the Rewards Program. In addition, Your earning and accrual of cash is contingent upon Cash'D in-fact receiving related compensation from the applicable third-party; If the applicable third-party does not pay Cash'D, then Cash'D is not liable or responsible for crediting your account with the corresponding cash. Company shall not be responsible or liable for, nor shall Company be obligated to award earnings or Cash'D cash to Users whose participation in a Rewards Program is not properly recorded, tracked, and/or deemed approved under Company’s or its Third-Party Partner’s policies and any earnings previously granted may be revoked. No earnings will be awarded if a User is deemed to have been using ad blockers or ad blocking technology. Company relies on industry-vetted tracking tools including Impact, AppsFlyer, Adjust, Singular, and HasOffers/TUNE. While the Company makes every effort to implement and test these tracking tools, Company bears no responsibility for any activities reported as completed by Users for which it has no record. Company is not responsible for actions or errors of any third-party including Third-Party Partners.
    While using Company’s Services, you may use a service, download software, or purchase goods provided by another company. Use of those services, software, or goods may be subject to separate terms between You and the other company. You agree to comply with such third-party terms, and agree that Cash'D is not responsible for any act or omission of these other companies; you are responsible. These Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies.
    Crediting of User earnings typically occurs within 30 days unless otherwise stated. Cash'D reserves the right to request that Users allow for reasonable crediting time for each Third-Party Partner to report User activities for the purposes of cash to User accounts.
    The Company may limit, suspend, or terminate Your ability to participate in a Rewards Program in its sole discretion. You agree to abide by the final and binding decisions of Company regarding any Rewards Program and Your participation in it. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or cancel all or a portion of a Rewards Program, including any points or progress You may have accrued, at any time.
</p>
<h3>B. Giveaways, Referrals, and Special Rewards Programs</h3>
<p>
    Giveaways, referrals, and special or limited-time-offer programs (collectively, “Rewards Programs”) may be subject to additional rules and regulations.
    The Cash'D Daily Giveaways Program is open to all eligible, active Users. Users are automatically enrolled upon starting a new session in Cash'D. All participants are subject to our policy (which are incorporated herein by reference) and these Terms.
    The Cash'D Refer a Friend (“Referral”) Program allows Users to be awarded (“Referral cash”) for each referred user (“Referred Friend”) earns from participating in games and offers with Cash'D. The Referral Program requires that Your and the Referred Friend’s accounts remain active and non-fraudulent. Referred Friends may include family members, but excludes additional Cash'D accounts you have created for yourself using a different email address. We reserve the right to withhold or refuse earnings if Your or the Referred Friend’s activity or account is deemed fraudulent or in violation of these Terms.
</p>
<h3>C. Redemption of Earnings</h3>
<p>
    Users may redeem Cash'D cash for cash value via Giftcards. A historical record of a User’s past redemptions of giftcards can be found on the User’s account page. Payments to approved User accounts are made on a regular biweekly basis. Cash'D reserves the right to change the method of payment or cashout at any time.
    If you choose to redeem Cash'D cash in the form of cashRewards gift cards (“Gift Card”), You are solely responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information you provide in connection with the issuance of such Gift Card. Only those Gift Cards listed in the gift card provider’s catalog may be selected for redemption. You acknowledge and agree that the applicable Gift Card merchant (the “Issuer”), and not Cash'D, is the issuer of the Gift Card. Gift Cards are subject to the availability of the Issuer and we may be required by an Issuer to impose quantity limits on a Gift Card order, reject all or any part of a Gift Card order, or discontinue the Gift Cards of a specific Issuer. Cash'D is not liable for the Gift Card once it is issued to You; the Gift Card can only be used in accordance with (and You agree to abide by) the terms and conditions of the Issuer. The Gift Card cannot later be exchanged for cash, check, or credit. If the Gift Card is lost or stolen, it will not be replaced. You agree not to offer Gift Cards for any purpose to any country which is subject to embargo or other trade restrictions of the United States Government, or any government by which laws You are bound, or otherwise use a Gift Card in any manner that violates applicable laws. Cash'D may suspend Your ability to redeem Cash'D cash for a Gift Card at any time, without notice.
</p>
<h3>D. Pending Period</h3>
<p>
    All User Cash'D cash will have a Pending Period associated with it in order to account for chargebacks, returns, or actions the Third-Party Partner ascertains or believes in its business judgment to be fraudulent. Untoward behavior, manipulation, or any other actions by the User deemed to be not in keeping with the intent of the Rewards Program, which is to be provided to Users who are highly engaged with and exhibit genuine interest and intent in the Third-Party Partner’s products or services, may have their reward(s) reversed, in Cash'D’s or its Third-Party Partner’s sole discretion.
</p>
<h3>E. Product or Service Returns, Reversals, Fraud, or Suspected Fraud</h3>
<p>
    Cash'D may reverse any user earnings if a User signed up for a product trial or service or purchased a product and then canceled the trial, service, or shipment of the product. Cash'D furthermore reserves the right to cancel, or temporarily suspend, such User accounts with any and all earnings forfeited if Cash'D determines, in its sole discretion, that the User signed up for the purpose of receiving a reward without having genuine interest in the product, offer, or service, or otherwise engaged in fraudulent, illegal or deceptive conduct or conduct prohibited by these Terms.
</p>
<p>
    Cash'D may temporarily suspend, without notice, a User account for up to 30 days to investigate suspected fraudulent activity. Suspended Users may continue participating in active games and offers. Suspended Users only receive notice that their account is suspended if they attempt to log in to Cash'D with the suspended account. Users can request that Cash'D review their account after answering questions about their recent account activity. Cash'D reserves the right to close the account and deem all earnings forfeited without notice to the User if the account is deemed fraudulent. Accounts deemed non-fraudulent will be reactivated with no further action required by User.
</p>
<p>
    Cash'D may also deny or reverse any User earnings and reserves the right to cancel any User accounts, in its sole discretion, if it determines that Users misrepresented themselves in any Surveys. Users are expected to answer any surveys thoughtfully and with accurate information.
</p>
<h3>F. Unclaimed Earnings</h3>
<p>
    Users who have not signed into their account for ninety (90) days are considered inactive.

<h3>3. USER CONDUCT</h3>

<h4>A. Inactivity</h4>
<p>
    The Company urges Users to ensure their account remains active by using the Platform and Company Services and performing activities that increase their User account balance. Payment requests will be removed if a User's account becomes inactive for any reason. The automated system deactivates User's accounts based on the below criteria and runs immediately before payments are processed. Therefore, it is possible for a User's account to be set to inactive immediately before their payment is processed. A User's account will be set to inactive for any of the following reasons:
</p>
<p>
    1. Invalid E-mail address: If the Platform receives a bounce-back error message or similar message when sending an e-mail to a User, then that User's account will be set to inactive. A bounce-back message may occur if the User has added the Platform to their “Ignore list,” the User has marked a message from the Platform as spam, or for other reasons. In order for email communications to be delivered to the User's inbox, the User must add the Platform to their contact list and check their spam and or junk folder to ensure delivery of Company emails to the User’s inbox.
</p>
<p>
    2. Failure to confirm email communications after repeated emails sent: If a User does not respond to any email communications by not clicking on the links within any email communications after an appropriate period of time, their account will be set to inactive. The Platform reserves the right to change this number at any time. Users are responsible for ensuring delivery of email to the User inbox.
</p>
<p>
    3. Outdated or inactive contact information: Users are responsible for maintaining accurate and complete contact information and promptly updating such information. This includes the User’s personal contact information and email address. Users are responsible for any issues with their email service provider. If any payment sent out to a User is returned to us for any reason, including due to inaccurate or outdated contact information, we may continue to hold such payment for up to sixty (60) days. We may resend the payment upon the User’s request and the receipt of the correct contact information within the sixty (60) day period. If we do not receive a request from the User to resend payment along with corrected contact information within ninety (90) days, then all earnings giving rise to the payment are deemed forfeited and the payment is forfeited and permanently waived.
</p>
<p>
    4. Lack of activity: Users who have not signed into their account for ninety (90) days are considered inactive. If a User's account is considered inactive for lack of activity, all verified earnings are considered unclaimed and may be forfeited. If a User's account becomes inactive, the User can reactivate it within six (6) months of the account being placed on inactive status. In order to reactivate an inactive account, Users must log into the inactive account and request that a confirmation email be sent to them. When the User clicks the link provided in the confirmation email, the User’s account will be reactivated. For purposes of clarity, when a User's account is reactivated, any forfeited earnings may not be claimed or reclaimed.
</p>
