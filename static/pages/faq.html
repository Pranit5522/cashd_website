            <blockquote class="question">Q2. How Do I Redeem Cashback?</blockquote>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A. Confirmed Cashback can be redeemed in 3 ways: Bank Transfers, Paytm Transfers or via UPI transfers. <br>To redeem your balance, you can raise a transfer request in the Wallet section by following the steps given below: </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Select the wallet</li>
                <li>Select the amount to be redeemed</li>
                <li>Choose the mode of withdrawal i.e bank, UPI or Paytm.</li>
                <li>Request transfer</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Bank transfers take between 5-7 business days to reflect in your account whereas E-Wallet transfers are almost instantaneous but can take upto 48 hours to reflect in your account.</p>

          <h2>I cannot understand the different states of Cashback.</h2>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <blockquote class="question">Q1. What does Pending Cashback mean?</blockquote>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A. Pending Cashback means we have tracked your transaction at a retailer via Cash'd and it has been acknowledged by the retailer as well. However, since this is still within the Return or Cancellation period, you cannot transfer or redeem this money yet.</p>
              <p>For example: If you make a purchase from Myntra.com via Cash'd, you will get an email from us acknowledging that you have Pending Cashback of Rs.XXX within 5-30 minutes.</p>
              <p>Now, once the cancellation/return period is over, Myntra.com will confirm Cashback and pay us from their end. Once we get this confirmation, your Rs.XXX will go from "Pending" to "Confirmed" status. However, if you cancel your order, the Cashback will be cancelled as well.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <blockquote class="question">Q2. What does Confirmed Cashback mean?</blockquote>
            <p class="answer">A. Confirmed Cashback is what has been approved as a valid purchase from retailers.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <blockquote class="question">Q3. What does Requested Cashback mean?</blockquote>
            <p class="answer">A. Once you request for money transfer via bank/upi/paytm, the status of your transaction changes to "requested".</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <blockquote class="question">Q4. What does Paid Cashback mean?</blockquote>
            <p class="answer">A. Once your Requested Cashback is sent to your Bank/Paytm account, the status of your cashback changes to "paid".</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <blockquote class="question">Q5. What does Declined Cashback mean?</blockquote>
            <p class="answer">A. In certain cases, like cancellation of order or in case the retailer declares your transaction as invalid, the status of your transaction changes to "cancelled". This means we have not been paid by the retailer and therefore will not be able to pay you any cashback.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <blockquote class="question">Q6. Why was my cashback declined?</blockquote>
            <p class="answer">A. Your cashback can be declined in one of these cases:-</p>
            <div>
              <ol>
                <li>Your ordered amount was less than the minimum order value of that offer.</li>
                <li>The order was cancelled.</li>
                <li>The order was returned or the delivery of the order was refused.</li>

          <h2>I did not receive my cashback.</h2>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <blockquote class="question">Q1. I made a purchase but have not received any cashback for it. What can I do?</blockquote>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A. If you made a purchase less than 3 days ago, please wait a little longer. It can take between 5 minutes to 72 hours for retailers to track sales.</p>
              <p>However, if you made a purchase over 3 days ago but haven't received an acknowledgment of the purchase , please submit a Missing Cashback ticket within 7 days from the date of transaction.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, retailers fail to track a transaction on their end. After we receive transaction details from you, we can follow this up with the retailer, and attempt to get your Missing Rewards.</p>

          <h2>I have other issues</h2>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <blockquote class="question">Q1. Why does cashback take so long to confirm?</blockquote>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A. This varies from retailer to retailer. After you perform a transaction you will get an email from us within 5 minutes to 72 hours telling you how much Cashback is due to you. This is called 'Pending' Cashback.</p>
              <p>Once the return period of your product(s) is over/stay is completed, the retailer knows that the transaction was genuine, and pays us. Following this the status of your Cashback will automatically change to 'Confirmed'. From the time of your purchase, it could take between 48 hours to 90 days for your Cashback to get confirmed.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
